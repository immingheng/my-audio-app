# Steps to start the backend server
node server.js

## The database connection should have been acquired and configured in index.js

## REST API calls are made via AXIOS in frontend to backend to serve whichever data required - CRUD operations on user profile and audio files.

## Attached in SQL folder contains a sql script to initialize the database - 2 tables (user_table and audio_files) 

## I got stuck with the creating the API routes required.
